**Example 5.4.** In [fill in], we compute $\Omega(I)$ and show that it is a union of 72 of the 102 maximal cones of $\mathrm{Sec} \mathcal{A}(I)$. 

**Example 5.5.** In [fill in], we compute the fan $\Omega(I)$ for the Pluecker ideal $I = I_{3,6}$ and show that it has 30 maximal cones of dimension 10 and 10 more maximal cones of dimension 8. 

**Appendix B.** In [fill in], we create functions that compute the point configuration $\mathcal{A}(I)$ associated to the ideal $I$.
